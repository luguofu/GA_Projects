You assumed I was uninformed and hadn’t been noticing the same promises of reopening spewed repeatedly. The reason why i’m more optimistic now is because the reopening seems to be grounded in better reasoning now (particularly the reasoning that has led to reopening being delayed so long) which is vaccinations WITHIN Bali, number of cases and mortality rates. I appreciate they could still delay to 2022, but it’s DEFINITELY more viable for it to reopen now compared to, for example, July.

I deleted my responses because they were a bit much. And now I obviously realise you weren’t trying to be a cunt.

Ultimately I think everyone’s just waiting to get back out there and I imagine the wait has been a little longer (and disappointing, thanks to the Indonesian govt and it’s empty indications) for some than others.

Indonesia is an easy country to turn up and stay for a little while, much more difficult to stay long term without a family connection of throwing money at the problem.

&amp;#x200B;

How different is the culture in Bali compared to other place in Indo? Never went to Bali before so I'm more worried about the culture shock than anything else honestly.

**Well i could say Balinese culture is very different toward most places in Indo, especially places with predominantly muslim. Most of balinese people doesnt care at all at what you do as long as you doesnt disturb them. You can get drunk all the time, party, topless as long as you doesnt harrass anyone. Its a pretty laidback society. Thats why you can usually find bules have villas or home in the middle of nowhere in Bali and they live happily there. My advice is when this covid going down, try to have your holiday in bali for 1 week and dont just visit the tourism area only, visit other places as well.**

&amp;#x200B;

How about the housing price? Is it reasonable for locals? Is it hard to buy house there?

**Depends on the area of course. But i think our prices is still a bit lower than Jakarta or Surabaya, except the land near tourism area, which are crazy high. Buying house here is not hard as long you are WNI.**

My girlfriend is Chinese, and there is a large Chinese minority in Indonesia (as well as in Malayisa), including Yogia and Surabaya. So people there are used to them not following muslim traditions, and she has never faced any kind of discrimination, staring down or whatnot. In general Indonesian people are rather peaceful.

Unfortunately I don't have much input on West Nusa Tenggara, I have been to Lombok once taking the ferry from Bali, but I didn't travel with my dog and since the province is rather sparsely populated, we didn't consider it for now since we will to find employment, which is always easier in population centers.

To the best of my knowledge, *all* animal imports must go through Jakarta, so even if Lombok or other provinces permit them, you need to clear the quarantine in Jakarta and can then continue travelling domestically. But take that with a grain of salt, I'm certain about Java and Bali but the rest is a bit of heresay since I never looked deeply into it.

People there usually aren't strict, militant or anything and I've seen many households with dogs, but just something to keep in mind in general.

Both dog &amp; cat are strays that I picked up from the streets here in China, so no clue what's mixed into. My dog almost certainly has some corgi genes, the cat is truly randomized :-P

Having a dog in Bali can be stressful. Between dog napping, poisoning and other bullshit, something bad can happen to your dog and sometimes does. Rabies is fairly common amongst street dog populations and they freely roam on the beach and elsewhere. They aren't always friendly. My friend's dog had it's skull half crushed due to being an overly friendly puppy. She's ok, but only has one eye now. 

Other than all this, leaving Bali with your fur child will be difficult and expensive.

You'll run the same gauntlet in reverse with the same risks and potentially stricter quarantine upon return to wherever you're coming from. Most countries do not allow dogs that have been in Bali to enter, so you need to have that story buttoned down. Your dog might not have a passport but you do. Won't take much for a customs officer to connect the dots.

I'm not particularly your typical german-German, so no worries there.

So it seems getting your dog to Jakarta/Javi is easy and no problem, no bribes necessary? It's just a more expensive flight - but that'd be the same as taking my dog anywhere.
Also are those places more dog friendly? Less poisoning,  less threats?

It is only from then on, getting from jakarta/javi to Bali, where it gets tricky?
If I were to take the ferry from there to Bali, would I be able to accompany the dog or would he be with the people I bribed/agency I paid?

Do you mind sharing the agency you'd trust? Gladly via DM, if necessary.

Also you seem to know a lot - do you have a dog in Bali?

TLDR: javi/Jakarta is easy and official and same as taking my dog to, say, the States?
Bali includes ferries, bribery and only one agency I can trust, but once there, no worries as long as I keep him leashed?

[],,,limabintang,,,[],,,,text,t2_5r0uso5a,False,False,"It's illegal to bring a dog into or out of Bali. But you can do it if you're willing to pay and break the law -- not a very German thing but most locals don't have an issue with it and the rationale of the law at present is just to facilitate bribes, especially if your dog is sterilized so it can't impact the native dog genetics which are already hopelessly impacted. Method is to fly the dog to Jakarta, where it's legal to import a dog, and then drive it to Bali via the ferry.

Cost for the flight depends on the airline and not all airlines fly animals but should be something like 500-1000 USD if you're flying with the dog. The road trip to Bali is 500-2000 USD including quarantine in Jakarta and there is some risk the animal gets caught at the ferry and would typically be euthanized if this happens. There's paperwork involved in the flight but the agent handling quarantine should do this for you.

There's one agency that very openly advertises and seems to have bribed everyone sufficiently that they avoid issues and is the high price. I'd be ok trusting my dog to them but not any of the other agencies, especially given large breeds are riskier as they can't be well hidden on the ferry.

You should also really think about the return journey in advance. I don't know about Germany but some countries like Australia don't import dogs from countries with rabies no matter their vaccination status and would need to be redomiciled in a third country, which takes six months and can be traumatic.

The environment for dogs in Bali is less sanitary than Western countries and they'd be exposed to unhealthy free roaming dogs unless you kept them in a walled area. Theft is towards a myth but intentional poisoning isn't, especially if you have problems with your neighbors and in public areas like beaches where a vendor might not appreciate them. But it's otherwise a dog friendly place and you can take them to the beach for walks and into a lot of restaurants without issue.",,,,,,,,,1630243662,,,{},hastv30,False,t3_pdte5e,False,True,t3_pdte5e,/r/bali/comments/pdte5e/moving_from_germany_with_ridgeback_dog/hastv30/,,2,,True,False,bali,t5_2qsn8,,,,0,[],[],1630316293.0,,

Hi smokingparty, what's the (unspoken?) Balinese attitude to the number of Javanese that live and operate business on Bali. **This is a hard question to answer and pretty sensitive one. Just like other part in Indonesia, whenever you are majority there will be always a clash with the minority. Im balinese but my religion is not hindu, so i understand this part as well. In the city and tourism part the racist attitude is very minimal. But in other parts, it is still small but noticeable. Personally i think balinese is not that harsh to javanese, you can see lot of mosque in bali, but yeah i understand why you ask this. One thing as well, from balinese perspective, they still have that wound over the bali bombing, so they blame javanese for that.**

How is it now? **Covid wise, its getting better. 3,1 mil ppl (73%) already been vaccinated for the 1st dose and 1,6 mil for the 2nd dose (38%) total population in bali is 4,3 mil ppl (census from 2020).**

Have the locals who rely on the tourism dollar found a way to make money? **Hard question to answer. Yes and no. Some ppl find other way to make money other get a new job (farming, property development, selling food, etc) but lot also still struggling. People who doesnt have other skill than their usual job is struggling the most. They doesnt have capital to start a business nor land to farm. I put my self as example and a lucky one. Got another job in a multinational corp, but lot of my friends is not as lucky as i am. There is a lot of job seeker now, like really a lot. They even dont care if the pay is much lower than what they get.**

&amp;#x200B;

When things get back to a relative normal do you think Bali will be the same? **It would be back like the precovid time, at least in the surface.

Many friends stayed behind but most have since left as the situation got worse and it became clear they weren't getting vaccinated any time soon if they stayed.  Our current plans are to return around June next year if things have settled down a bit.

Getting into Indonesia right now is practically impossible unless you're a resident, and frankly going there right now isn't a great idea anyway.  They're coming off the back of their worst COVID wave and the hospital infrastructure is easily overwhelmed.  You have to think about things other than COVID, what happens if you break your leg in an accident and the hospitals are full of COVID patients.  Getting out is also a painful process if you wanted to get home for medical treatment.

Lets pretend you're going in the future when things have settled down to some kind of normal.

I try avoid the politics of visas and stick to the facts, these are a real simplification as there are hoops to jump through.  B211 class visa can get you in for up to 6 months, a visa agent will organise everything for around $500usd.  You aren't supposed to work under those visas but many people do.  If you stay longer than 180 days you must file taxes in Indonesia, even if you've just been living off savings and won't actually pay any taxes, not filing is a good way to get into a heap of trouble.  Based on what the border situation was like before the recent lockdown, you can expect to require full COVID vaccination, negative PCR tests and pay for 8 nights of hotel quarantine in Jakarta before you can then fly onwards to Bali.",,,,,,,,,1629163920,,,{},h98gw7t,False,t3_p51lgk,False,False,t1_h95nftn,/r/bali/comments/p51lgk/bali_full_of_surfer_bros/h98gw7t/,,1,,True,False,bali,t5_2qsn8,,,,0,[],[],1629242191.0,,

We have used Singapore Airlines premium economy from Australia to Europe via Singapore a few times (all up about 16 hours) and while it sure isn’t business class it’s better than straight up economy. Not all premium economy is equal though - it really depends on the plane. Check out seat guru first before you book. You do get a bit of extra leg room but the seats are the same regardless. I prefer the row of two seats alone just behind the galley. Yes it’s noisy but it easier to get up and stretch out. 

Don’t worry about Bali being difficult at your size. As long as you are fit and mobile you’ll be fine. Especially in Sanur - there are quite a few bigger older people there and the place allows for that. But I would urge you to get out and about a bit. A few days in a hotel in Sidemen would show a completely  different side of the island. Plus I find villas boring as (but then I guess it depends on how you live at home) and they can be very isolating. In a nice hotel or resort you have a lot more facilities available to you.

Canggu - Trendy hipsters and social media bros and sisters. Wannabe surf bros. Tattoos everywhere. Playground for adults with unresolved relationship issues. As a friend once put it: ""if you're reasonably attractive in \[south\] Bali, you'll get further than you would in most parts of the world"".

Seminyak/Kerobokan/Petitenget - These days a little bit of a dead zone as it's usually frequented by tourists. However most of Bali's less colourful characters live here, as it's a bit more 'normal' compared to Canggu or Ubud.

Kuta - Drunk old Australians. Chinese tourists. With covid in full effect, tumbleweeds can now be spotted there.

Sanur - Drunk old people from all nationalities, or jaded long-term Bali expats that have grown tired of the south west coast and need a break from the superficiality. It's quieter and more family oriented. A taste of Bali 20 years ago. Dive shops everywhere as it's a popular jumping off point to Nusa Penida and other dive sites.

Ubud - Yoga types, burning man festival rejects, spiritual folk or families. Also home to people that have no interest in the beach or run businesses in the area. It's not quite as hippie as people make it out to be, but definitely you will see a lot of white people with dreadlocks. Lol

Uluwatu - The up and coming new home for Ubud hippies and Canggu surf bros/trendy people in-the-know that are now too cool for Canggu. Also a few very wealthy people that live up in the hills, but those are much rarer. I haven't personally spent much time there other than an occasional beach day, but it's certainly a lot less pretentious than Canggu.

Berawa - The middle ground. A lot of digital nomad types and people with 'real jobs' live here. Not quite Canggu and not quite Seminyak/Kerobokan.

The main takeaway here is that Bali has a bit of everything. If you know what you're looking for it's easy to dodge the 'crazy' people and move towards more of what you're interested in. Also, b211a visas are currently on hold due to the Delta variant, so immigration isn't letting anyone into the country unless you have a residency permit. This may change in the coming weeks (but nothing official yet), so keep your ears to the ground.

That right there is the outcome of said research... Making it exceptionally hard to ultimately come to a solid conclusion.

Fun fact, I've been considering dual citizenship in order to bypass the ownership restrictions. It's not particularly difficult, 5 years local employment and speak Indonesian, the rest is just paperwork.

You have to rescind your original nationality since Indonesia doesn't recognize dual citizens, however my country of origin grants the right to retain citizenship. I'd give up my passport but have a letter confirming that I am still considered a citizen, and can basically walk right back into the embassy and have my passport reissued. 

That latter part is dicey however since it would violate the citizenship requirements for Indo. Not that anyone would be able to tell them since they are of course vowed to secrecy and all that, but you never know. People talk.

However - I cant stand areas that are overcrowed by western 'digital nomads' and tourists. So pretty much the tourist hotspots I avoid.

Note that that is not all westerners, it's very very common to see it in the tourist areas. 

The culture is beautiful, the people are the most kind I've ever met anywhere in the world, and the landscape is stunning. 

I  think I just miss waking up the humidity, the gamelan playing somewhere nearby and making conversation with locals

I don't surf or go to bars, or hang out at western cafe's or yoga etc, I kind of enjoy just wandering around admiring it all. But I'm a bit weird like that.

If you're doing engineering, depending on what sort, I'd suggest trying to get a job in mining and do fly in fly out for an Australian mine and live in Bali on your off time. 

The glamour of living a low cost life in Bali might be appealing, but the reality is that if you don't have money things can go sideways fast. 

Make sure you have proper health insurance that will pay out if things go to shit, get a motorbike licence in your home country and an international driver's permit if you want to ride a bike in Bali. Insurance won't pay out if you're riding without one and crash. 

I assume you're doing all this after the global pandemic is over? If so, I'd recommend just doing a backpacking trip starting in Laos, down through Vietnam &gt; Thailand and then jumping to Bali. Experience them all, meet foreigners who actually live in those places legally and get some advice.

Also there are no financial details in your post, but for many people moving to places like Bali or Thailand their success is highly dependent on how much money they've got, whether it's in real estate, an investment portfolio, pension, online biz or another source of income. There is no safety net there, no parents to go back to if things go wrong. Getting a work permit is extremely hard and even if you do, the salary is likely to be a fraction of what you'd make in the US doing the same job.

So my answer to you, without knowing much about you other than that you are young, is this: if you are a trust fund kid or already have a solid, location independent source of income, you can hang out in Bali for a year or two and see if you like it. Otherwise work on building up your net worth while you are in the US.

You literally said ""you just have to want it, like you wanted independence"" when clearly it was a byproduct of WW2 ending instead of simply a strong will to be independent. 

I grew up in the Netherlands and know European history very well thank you. How Netherlands got their independence 300 years before Indonesia is not only irrelevant, but supports my point that they had a massive head start to evolve as a nation.

I already said that all developed nations needed multiple generations to change their mentality - particularly when switching from pure monarchy to some form of democracy. Your conclusion that ""everyone else was also corrupt once"" did not address anyone's point whatsoever. 

Today, corruptions are MORE prevalent in countries that were recently colonized, at a much much higher rate compared to their colonizers. This is a well-obseved fact, and there are hundreds of well-researched studies on this topic.

My point remains, saying to end corruption a nation would just need to ""want it"" is incredibly naïve and to me sound like an under-informed, over-privileged viewpoint. 

If you are really interested in informing yourself on this topic, I suggest starting with ""The Persistent Effect of Colonialism on Corruption"" (Angeles, 2015), and more recently ""Did British colonial rule in Africa foster a legacy of corruption among local elites?""

[],,,BrownArmy,,,[],,,,text,t2_7mn3l14v,False,False,"Of course it was still disputed. No nation in the world  would voluntarily gve up their 'money farm'. The Netherlands gave up their claim to what is now called Indonesia  because they had no other choice. Not because it's the 'right' thing to do. There is no such thing as charity in (geo)politics. Indonesia claims and holds for example West-Papua and Maluku. This could aguably be seen as Javanese colonialism. (I'm not taking sides, it's not my dispute, I am merely pointing out an example where views may differ).

I'd like to refer you to the independence of the Netherlands (then called the Dutch Republic). We got our independence from Habsburg Spain because of our collective willpower and determination for this to happen.  Back then, having the 'right' religion was still a very important issue. The Spanish were Catholic, the Netherlands mostly Protestant, and the Dutch did not want to serve a Catholic king out of fear of being discriminated or worse, forced to convert or prosecuted and rebelled. After 80(!) years of war, it finally concluded in Dutch independence. Because we did not give up. They did. Same for the French. Google the French revolution. It's a really fascinating part of history.

I'll refrain from using any sort of stereotype. I find them mostly negative. Regardless of who makes them. There are quite a few in our language too. Especially old ones regarding mostly about colonial 'subjects' and Germans/Belgians and some others.  

I did not say Indonesians ""finally wanted it in '45"".  The desire for self-determination is older. But as your history books mosy likely taught, the 'Indonesian identity' did not always exist. Especially not in the early days of the Dutch East Indies. This was purposely prevented by the Dutch. Much like how they never bothered to teach the people of the Dutch East Indies the Dutch language. This awareness of a common identity came to be much later as it was most likely actively prevented by Dutch colonial rule. The Dutch were a minority and if the majority wants something and collectively rise up, they can easily remove the minority from power. History proves this over and over.

I agree there are no nations with a 0% crime/corruption rate. Yet some governments seem infinitely more determined at dealing with this kind of societal self-sabotage.

In real numbers that's 3,068,969 out of a potential 3,405,130 candidates for vaccine, while 874,896 have had a second shot.

The shortfall between the stated 3.4 million vaccine candidates and the most recent census figure of 4.3 million I guess is down to the 70k foreign visitors who are currently ineligible for a vaccine and kids under the age of 12. 

Incidentally, 3,068,000 is around 71% of 4.3 million, so maybe that's where the figure comes from. Politicians, especially in RI, have an amazing ability to pull figures out of their ass when it suits their agenda, so who really knows?

The problem in Bali is the strict adherence to not vaccinating non Kita's/kitap holders, who will likely not try to vaccinate (maybe due to illegal visa status - others reasons may exist). The biggest problem is that most of the restaurants are ignoring the gov guidelines to keep their businesses afloat and so they can pay staff, who otherwise would have no income, which comes back to the patrons.

I believe the gov should be offering no questions asked vaccinations for nationals and foreigners. The goal right now should be to vaccinate not to raise overstay revenue.
