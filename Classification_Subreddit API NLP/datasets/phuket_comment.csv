You will be sent to a hospital, even if asymptomatic. You can find travel insurance that covers asymptomatic hospitalization to minimize the expense.

If not sent to a hospital, you would be sent to an ASQ hotel. Call a couple of them and ask what the cost of a two week stay would be. I would add a 20% ""because we can"" price increase to the quotes. That will get you an idea of what you would be looking at for the additional expense.

Now, figure this all into your travel plan as a worst case scenario and plan to have access to the necessary funds if needed. 

You can further minimize these risks by limiting your exposure to crowds and large gatherings and by avoiding businesses that have direct physical (hands on) contact with the general public, such as massage shops. They may take precautions but then again, maybe they don't, and that's just outside your control.

Yes, Phuket is not an IT hub nor much of a DN place, local IT people generally head to Bangkok

&gt; If so, are there likely to be any unforeseen difficulty (other than hiring) in getting staff to relocate?

Foreign staff, doubt anything extra over anywhere else in Thailand. Thai staff might be bit be bit more difficult as they might not want to leave BKK

&gt; For example will buying laptops be more of a challenge?

You will want to do it all online as cheaper to get shipped from BKK

Depends on what you´re looking for. It´s definitely not what it used to be. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57F0g0Op7ys) from a month ago shows a walk through Patong which used to be the party center of the island - not much has changed since recording. As you can tell, it´s pretty much dead. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtZp8qpnBs), while it´s mainly about the sex industry, paints a pretty good picture of the current situation and the production value is better than the other one so it may be a more interesting watch.Basically if you are coming for the people and the parties, now is not the time. If you are coming here for the beaches however, well, they are still here and less crowded. The hotels are quite empty, so if that´s your thing then sure - although sometimes it feels almost like a ghost town, particularly in the northern parts of the island. The Sandbox application process is a bit of a drag and requires some work before arriving - but it´s not hard, just frustrating and time-consuming.

&gt;Second question, are Muay Thai gyms open in Phuket?

This has been a yes/no thing for a while. In the last three months they have been closed and reopened twice. They are closed today, but the new order stipulates that they will be allowed to open on the first of September. I just checked with management at my gym two hours ago and they said that they will open as usual the day after tomorrow. That being said it is a bit of a gamble if you come here counting on them to be open. However, there is the caveat that you may still be able to purchase private lessons at otherwise closed gyms; but this is more expensive, you won´t be training with anyone except a coach, and not all gyms offer this.",,,,,,,,,1630332217,,,{},haxhkkc,False,t3_peh9ur,False,True,t3_peh9ur,/r/phuket/comments/peh9ur/is_the_sandbox_worth_it/haxhkkc/,,1,,True,False,phuket,t5_2qwdi,,,,0,[],[],1630405951.0

There, they checked my docs again and stamped my passport. Then I waited again for the flight at the gate. Got onboard and flew out. 

As far as tracking apps, I deleted when I got back into America. You could probably delete it in the airport once your passport has been stamped because you're probably not going to be allowed out of international terminal anyways. Still, maybe wait until you land in layover destination. Thai government can be petty so maybe if the flight had trouble and turned back after departure, some technical bureaucrat might make a stink about the app being deleted.

To give you an idea of their pettiness, an American was arrested in Thailand on separate matter and sat in prison for awhile. After he was acquitted, he went to leave the country, having been set free. Well, it's hard to renew visa while in prison, so he overstayed his visa.

PHUKET: The Phuket Regional Blood Center at Saphan Hin is in urgent need of blood donors for a long-term Phuket expat who cannot undergo open-heart surgery without it.

By The Phuket News
Wednesday 25 August 2021, 10:43AM

Peter Ferry from Glasgow, Scotland, explained to The Phuket News this morning that he is at Bangkok Hospital Phuket waiting for the blood donations so he can undergo the surgery.
Peter is 87 years old. Fluent in written and spoken Thai, he has been living in Thailand for 67 years.
Peter’s blood type is B negative (B-), which is rare in Thailand.

He can receive blood donations from donors with blood types B- or O- only.
Any persons able to make a blood donation are urged to contact the Phuket Regional Blood Center at Saphan Hin at 076-251178 ext 2 or 081-9588854.
The center is located 8/193 Rattanakosin 200 Pi Rd near Saphan Hin (see map below).",,,,,,,,,1630000392,,,{},haga5q9,True,t3_pc17gz,False,True,t3_pc17gz,/r/phuket/comments/pc17gz/b_blood_needed_for_87_year_old_in_phuket_for_his/haga5q9/,,2,,True,False,phuket,t5_2qwdi,,,,0,[],[],1630078425.0

Story - Kasikorn bank in central festival Phuket required a rental contract or work permit for me to open a bank account as an American citizen. I was here on a tourist visa and lived with my then fiance in her own paid off house.

I read old forum info about some banks allowing tourists to open an account in Bangkok so I went there since I had related concerns to take care of. One of the Kasikorn banks there said that that Phuket branch is not following the rules when we explained the situation and our frustration. I was allowed to open an account in that Bangkok branch but they also said that they will call the central festival branch to set them straight. We decided to try to open the account in phuket again instead.

Well one week later I went to the central festival branch. They said yes I can open the account now and that the rules changed last week (shock! lol).

[],False,,Pieco,,,[],,,,text,t2_97kkw,False,False,"I returned from 10 days in Phuket last Monday Aug 4. Here's what I suggest:

1. Don't bring a lot of clothes. I mostly wore a bathing suit and shirts, and had stuff cheaply washed.
2. Be prepared for lots of rain right now, but
3. Also be agile, as the weather changes like... the weather. The forecast said that we'd have little sun, but we ended up with 6-7 prime beach days.
4. Be ready for desolation. Like, **everything** is closed in ""prime"" areas (like, Patong). We went to Kamala beach on our first day, and had to walk a bit to find a 7-11 for beverages. We went back to Kamala on our last day, and the 7-11 had closed up.
5. Old Town was not so desolate, and really lovely.
6. If you're going to hire a scooter or car, get your international driver's license. You apparently need it if things go wrong. If you're not used to scooters, get the smallest ones that you can find. You don't need to go fast right now.
7. Make sure that you're set with personal/toiletry items, as those can be expensive (or difficult to find).
8. Bring ""reef safe"" sunblock. They may be issuing fines for ""normal"" stuff (or so we were told).
9. Plan for 3+ hours for your second/third COVID tests. Not the fastest process.
10. Bring copies of \*everything\*. Having copies of passport and vaccine card were crucial.
11. Make sure that your phone has good battery (or you have a portable power bank). The required apps broadcast on bluetooth constantly, and will really eat up power.
12. Rethink accommodations, haggle in advance. I stayed at the best resort on the island at extremely sharp discount, and all of the spa services were likewise sharply discounted.
13. Don't haggle with the locals (I know that it's customary to do so) - they're really hurting, and it just isn't right to argue over $.50 or $1. I couldn't do it (unless someone was grossly trying to rip me off).
14. Get lots of small bills on the way in. 20's, 50's, 100's.

3. You can find great restaurant discounts on https://eatigo.com - sometimes 50% and above. I have amazing dinners at the four points Sheraton restaurant in Patong - some of the best food for great prices
4. Tunk-ka Cafe is on a hill (monkeys running around) has beautiful views of the city
5. Take a walk (4KM) up monkey hill - a really nice walk 
6. Getting to other provinces can be very tricky - plus take into account that some provinces enforce a mandatory 14 day isolated quarantine when you arrive from other provinces. Be very aware of what you are doing. And... rules change in Thailand by the day - so check every single day

I noticed a girl filming something on her phone and walking backwards and side to side. I didn't pay much mind and kept about with the hunched over digging I was doing. My girlfriend was a few meters away digging as well. I later found out from my girlfriend they she observed this girl looking back at me and using her phone's camera to try and ""accidentally"" bump into me. Likely to try and initiate a ""oops, hi"" conversation with me. The lady moved on when my girlfriend gave her the stink eye. 

The story here is you literally just have to be alone for a Thai girl to find you. They all know if you don't have a Thai girl on your arm, then you are likely single...because Thai girls won't let you get too far from them because they know some other girl is trying to make your acquaintance. My girl was a few meters away and it was apparently far enough for some other girl to think she could try to meet me. I'm not good looking either, just a normal, slightly overweight white guy looking like a typical tourist.

I stayed at Palmyra Patong and it was a nice hotel. It wasn't lavish but it wasn't in poor shape either. The pool was clean and the breakfast had a wide variety including a continental style buffet and a menu of a couple dishes they could serve you. The room had a clean smell and the bathroom had all the expected amenities, shower, tub, toilet, sink. It was walking distance to the beach and along the way was a laundry service that was 50b/kilo. Big C and many convenience stores nearby, as well as a pharmacy. Plenty of street food and restaurants. Lokal Restaurant nearby was nice. The beach was starting to come back to life as my holiday was concluding on 7/25. You'll be hounded by taxi drivers, just decline by saying mai kap (polite no) which sounds like ""My Cop"" in English. ""Shy Cop"" is polite yes.

I also stayed at Katathani Beach Resort which is a resort with several pools, poolside bars and restaurants, fancy dining, and a breakfast buffet. They have a convenience store on site. However, there's knot two restaurants and a convenience store off property so nothing much within walking distance. Fine if you like to stay in hotel property when traveling. It's right on the beach, like two minutes from room to sand, but right now the waves are too high for swimming. You might be better off on the east side of the province.

Honestly though, without a direct tie to someone there or without an intent to meet a special someone while on vacation, I would consider someplace like Cancun Mexico or maybe someplace that has a better grip on the Covid situation. Thailand's government, for the most part, relied too heavily on stopping Covid by closing the border instead of preparing for the inevitable surge.

Sand gets EVERYWHERE. You step in the box for one second, and then all of a sudden you have sand all over yourself. It gets underneath the nails, on your skin, embedded in clothes and probably sometimes in your lungs ironically. 

Thailand is full of A LOT of sand right now. The sand is multiplying. Having lots of sand babies. It's pretty of course but annoying in so so many ways. Sand can stop your ability to move around freely or go out late at night or in some cases drink anywhere outside your bathroom without a mask. 

Hope this amazing description has helped you plan your life.

Poor tourist in traction due to such, doing gofundme's to get out of hospital is a regular occurrence here",2cfeab252a511680278fe96207bd4c0295c8fff3,True,False,,,,,0.0,1627492010,,0.0,{},h6unvsy,False,t3_otbrfu,False,True,t3_otbrfu,/r/phuket/comments/otbrfu/got_a_traffic_fine_is_this_a_reliable_way_to_get/h6unvsy/,1627492042.0,1,False,True,False,phuket,t5_2qwdi,r/phuket,public,,0,[],,
